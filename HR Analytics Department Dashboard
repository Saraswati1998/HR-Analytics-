Project Title: HR Analytics Department Dashboard
Project Overview:
This project presents an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard created using Tableau. The dashboard is designed to provide key insights into an organization's workforce, helping HR departments and management make data-driven decisions. By visualizing key HR metrics, the dashboard enables users to monitor employee performance, analyze attrition trends, and understand demographic distributions at a glance.

Key Features of the Dashboard:

Employee Demographics: Visualizations that break down the workforce by department, job role, gender, and education level.

Performance Metrics: The dashboard tracks and displays key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess employee performance and overall departmental efficiency.

Attrition Analysis: Interactive charts to explore attrition rates and identify potential factors contributing to employee turnover.

Recruitment Funnel: A view of the recruitment process, from job openings to new hires, helping to optimize hiring strategies.

Interactive Filters: Users can filter the data by various parameters, such as department, job title, or hire date, to perform custom analysis.

Technical Stack:

Tableau: The primary tool used for creating all the visualizations and the interactive dashboard. The project file is a .twbx file, which includes both the dashboard and the underlying data.

Data Source: The data is stored in a .hyper file, which is a highly optimized data extract format for Tableau.

How to Use:

Download the HR ANALYTICS DEPARTMENT DASHBOARD.twbx file from this repository.

Open the file using Tableau Desktop.

Explore the various tabs and interactive filters to navigate through the HR data and gain insights.
